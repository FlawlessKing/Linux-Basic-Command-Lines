The course starts with basic outlines on Setting up a Virtual VM MAchine. 
The course uses 'Vagrant'

Setup for OS
-------------
1. Open ```Git Bash```
2. Change Directories to Desktop. Command ```cd desktop```
3. Make a new directory. Command ```mkdir Shell```
4. Download the Vagrantfile. Command `Vagrant init`
5. Now you are ready to use it.

Starting OS

1. Type `vagrant up` in bash
2. Wait for all the files to start
3. Type `vagrant ssh` once the VM Machine Booted.
